## Summary
* Accurate and reliable prediction of leaf traits is crucial for understanding plant adaptations to environmental variation, monitoring terrestrial ecosystems, and enhancing comprehension of functional diversity and ecosystem functioning.
* Various approaches (e.g., statistical, physical models) have been developed to estimate leaf traits through hyperspectral remote sensing and leaf spectroscopy. However, the absence of high-performing, transferable, and stable models across various domains of space, plant functional types (PFTs) and seasons hinder our ability to quantify and comprehend spatiotemporal variations in leaf traits. 
* This study proposes robust and highly transferable models for better predicting leaf traits with hyperspectral reflectance. Three datasets were assembled, pairing common leaf traits — chlorophyll (Chla+b, µg/cm<sup>2</sup>), carotenoids (Ccar, µg/cm<sup>2</sup>), leaf mass per area (LAM, g/m<sup>2</sup>), equivalent water thickness (EWT, g/m<sup>2</sup>) — with leaf spectra measurements collected across diverse geographic locations in the U.S. and Europe, PFTs, and seasons. 
* Through comparison with other state-of-the-art statistical models, including partial-least squares regression (PLSR) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), as well as pure physical models, we found that the proposed transfer learning models achieved better predictive performance and higher transferability. 

* **Objectives:**
  * **_(1) Do our proposed transfer learning models for predicting leaf traits have better performance than other state-of-the-art statistical models like PLSR and GPR, and the pure RTMs?_**
  * **_(2) Are the transfer learning models more transferable across different geographic locations, PFTs, and seasons than other models?_** 
  * **_(3) How the inconsistency and the quantity of real observations used for fine-tuning influence the performance of transfer learning models?_**

* **Conclusions:**
  * Numerous models have been developed to predict leaf traits based on leaf spectroscopy, each of which has its limitations. The absence of universally high-performing, transferable, and stable models across different domains hinder our ability to quantify and comprehend spatiotemporal variations in leaf traits and their responses to environmental changes and biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems. 
  * In this study, we ensembled three types of datasets, with significant variability in leaf traits and leaf spectra across different locations, PFTs, and seasons. Our proposed transfer learning models, incorporating domain knowledge from RTMs and limited observational data, achieved better predictive performance compared to other statistical models and pure RTMs.
  * The transfer learning models exhibited higher transferability than statistical models. Our study underscores that transfer learning models can harness the advantages of both RTMs and statistical models and represent a promising approach for effectively predicting leaf traits.
